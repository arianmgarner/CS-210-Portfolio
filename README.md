# CS-210-Portfolio

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I chose to display Project One. This project was to make a 12-Hour Clock and a 24-Hour Clock that can have time added to them at the same time. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe I was able to get the display to look relatively nice. I think I did particularly well at keeping the clocks in sync.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I can improve my code in areas where it pertains to displaying output. I did it the inefficient and time consuming way during this project. It was a lesson to be learned. I would meed to have a better understanding of formatting and spacing in displaying output. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
For me, it was challenging to write code for a clock that syncs with the clock on my PC, but does not count up or dowm until user input is taken. I was able to make a fully functional clock that syncs with my system and counts in real time before I was able to do what was required for the project. I ended up emailing my teacher and explaining what I was struggling with. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
From this project, I was able to take away the ability to prevent myself from overthinking on a project and siking myself out. I can use my skills that I learned to incorporate time/date in a new project in the future.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made sure that I used comments in my code. I made sure that it had acceptable spacing that made the program easier to read. I did not want it all jumbled up.
